## Improvements

Not requiring z-parameters on the offline PC

Not scanning the full blockchain when importing an new address
-- send creation date (block) along with adres
-- if you know there's no funds on the adres skip the scanning altogether

Hide/disable sync to blockchain notification in the offline wallet

In offline mode: Hide Z-send button
               : Create a 'Z-sign' button to integrate offline signing into the GUI
